# Project Name

My First Backend is a project designed to teach the basics of Expresss while setting up a Frank Sinatra Wiki. 



## Usage

You can start the server by running "node app.js" which allows you to access the site via the browser or by using curl on you localhost. 

GET "/" will give randomly (in a pool of at least 20) a name of a song from Frank Sinatra.
